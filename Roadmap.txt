For v1.0.0 Alpha:
  Formula 1 Randomizer:

- Fix and finnish the Formula 1 Randomizer.


  Formula 1 Comparator:

- Make Formula 1 Comparator's overall rating calculations more sophisticated. Do this by having conditional statements for the calculations.
  For example if (driver1.skill > 80 and car1.performance < 70) {rating1 = calculation} and if (skill < 75 and performance > 90) 
  {other factor for the calculation} etc. 

- Decide this factor in the calculation. Difference in car and driver? Make the factor less/more effective depending on high/low skill/performance.

- Make it possible to create a custom driver/car. If the user chooses to do this the program will ask user to give ratings for different attributes.
  These attributes then themselves decide the final skill and performance in a TBD calculation. 

- For this I may have to create new classes and more parameters, like engine, downforce, power, pace, defending, overtaking, control and much more.


For v1.0.0 Beta:
- Make the general structure of the simulator program. The program will allow the user to either choose manually or randomize the grid for 
  each season. The program will simulate each season, each race and hand out points to finally decide both championships. I will create classes
  for the tracks. Each track will have different parameters like location and name, as well as different ways to calculate overall ratings based
  on whats important for that particular circuit, like high downforce, high speed, overtaking, pace and so on.

- Create constants (driver and car 1-20). Car 1-20 will already be decided but driver 1-20 will be pulled randomly from the array of drivers.

- Use randomizer to randomize. Comparator to decide ratings and make something that sorts them (array that push/pulls).

- The simulator will also gather statistics over time, like poles, wins and so on.

- Results in each race will be based on the array from the sorted ratings, which gives different probabilities for the results. Maybe the console
  describes events like engine failure, spin and so on.


Further updates:
- Add drivers and teams not currently in Formula 1. For example Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Dino Beganovic, Tyrell, BMW and SAAB.

- Add historic, and not currently used tracks such as Macau, China, Russia and Hockenheim.

- Add more aspects to the simulation? Money? Team principals? Weather? Pit stops?
